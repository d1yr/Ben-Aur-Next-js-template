## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with a few additions to get a project set up quickly.

- Emotion added for CSS-in-JS styling of components
- Storybook added for previewing components in development
- ESlint set up with Typescript rules
- Prettier added for formatting
- VSCode config to lint and format on save
- Precommit hook to type check, lint and format all staged files
- [SVGR webpack loader](https://react-svgr.com/docs/webpack/) to allow using svg files as components

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
